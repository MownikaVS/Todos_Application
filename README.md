# Todo's Application

**Project Overview:**

The Todo List Application is a web-based task management system that enables users to create, read, update, and delete tasks in a seamless and efficient manner. This application is designed to help individuals stay organized and focused by providing a simple yet effective way to manage their daily tasks.

**Features**

* **CRUD Operations**
    * **Create:** Add new tasks to the todo list with a simple and intuitive interface.
    * **Read:** View the list of tasks in the todo list, with clear and concise information about each task.
    * **Update:** Edit existing tasks in the todo list, with the ability to modify task details and status.
    * **Delete:** Remove tasks from the todo list, with a confirmation prompt to ensure accidental deletions are avoided.
* **Dynamic UI Updates** 
    The application updates the UI dynamically using JavaScript DOM operations, ensuring that the todo list is always up-to-date and reflects the latest changes.
* **Persistence**
    The todo list state is persisted on page reloads using local storage methods, ensuring that users can pick up where they left off, even after closing the browser or restarting their device.

**Technologies**

* **HTML:** Used for structuring and organizing content on the web page, providing a solid foundation for the application's UI.

    JavaScript event listeners were used to handle user interactions, such as clicking on buttons or submitting forms, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
* **DOM Manipulation**
    JavaScript DOM operations were used to dynamically update the UI, ensuring that the todo list is always up-to-date and reflects the latest changes.
* **Data Storage**
    Local storage methods were used to persist the todo list state on page reloads, ensuring that users can pick up where they left off, even after closing the browser or restarting their device.
* **Array and Object Methods**
